            <p className="mb-4">
              Connect4Good was founded in 2023 with a simple but powerful vision: to create 
              a platform that makes it easy for people to find meaningful ways to give back 
              to their communities and for non-profit organizations to reach the volunteers 
              and donors they need.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We believe that everyone has something valuable to contributeâ€”whether it's time, 
              skills, or resources. Our platform is designed to remove the barriers that often 
              prevent people from getting involved with causes they care about.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Since our launch, we've helped connect thousands of volunteers with organizations 
              doing important work in areas such as education, environmental conservation, 
              poverty alleviation, and more.
